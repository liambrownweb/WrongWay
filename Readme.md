Wrong Way, a clone of the ASCII-based game for DOS machines. This version differs in that:
1) is for GNU/Linux with ncurses, not DOS;
2) it does not precisely reproduce the look and feel of the original Wrong Way game.

NOTES
v. 0.0, first GitHub push

Current compilation is very straightforward. In the directory where main.c resides, enter:
`gcc main.c -lncurses`

Eventually I'll probably create a CMake or other build system for it, but this suffices
for the time being. Enjoy!

Oh, and one other thing: until further notice, this game is IN DEVELOPMENT and is not complete.
I'm not trying to create the next Minecraft just yet; this is supposed to be an exercise.
However, if there is much interest in it, I may take it further. Particularly if people start
sending me money via Paypal or something like that. Or if they contribute ideas backed up
with actual code.
